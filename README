APACHE CHANGES
==============
Whichever apache site you use to run the app, you will need to add a few directives so that we can have friendly urls. 
Adding the following will get rid of the need to specify the root index.php file. 
Just add it to the Directory tag in your httpd-vhosts.conf file.

<VirtualHost *:80>
  <Directory "/Users/ben/Sites/yii/test/webapp">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Order deny,allow
    Allow from all
    Satisfy all

	IndexIgnore */*
	RewriteEngine on
	# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
	RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

	# otherwise forward it to index.php
	RewriteRule . index.php

  </Directory>

  ServerAdmin info@benjaminlhaas.com
  DocumentRoot "/Users/ben/Sites/yii/test/webapp"
  ServerName test.local
  ServerAlias test.local
  ErrorLog "/private/var/log/apache2/yii-test-error_log"
  CustomLog "/private/var/log/apache2/yii-test-access_log" common
</VirtualHost>


APPLICATION INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Cloning this app from Github will result in the following:
test/
	README     [this file]
	Yii-1.1.8/ [Yii framework files]
	webapp/    [the web application files]

Create assets and runtime directory. From within application root, do the following:
mkdir webapp/assets
chmod 777 webapp/assets
mkdir webapp/protected/runtime
chmod 777 webapp/protected/runtime

File Permissions Note: You may also have to adjust some other directory permissions so that they are writable by the Web server process. 
At a minimum, the webapp/assets/ and webapp/protected/runtime/ directories needs to be writable by your Web server process.

* Create a new database and mysql user account, and configure with appropriate permissions:
CREATE DATABASE test;
CREATE USER 'test_dbuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password1';
GRANT INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, INDEX, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, SHOW VIEW, CREATE VIEW ON test.* TO 'test_dbuser'@'localhost';

* Update /webapp/protected/config/main.php with the newly created mysql database name and credentials

* Run the data migration:
From the Shell cd to /your/project/path/webapp
% protected/yiic migrate
